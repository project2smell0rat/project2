# Foundation App

This is a basic foundation level application that will allow you to hit the ground running.

This contains pretty all of the ground level tooling you'll need, such as express, mysql, tests, some views, and routing. You just have to use it!

## How To

- `clone` or `fork` this repo
- `cd` into the folder on your desktop
- run `npm i`
- Good luck

## Technology

- Express
- MySQL
- EJS (Templating)
- Tape (Testing)
  - Test tooling is included but you'll have to setup your own tests if you want to use them
- StandardJs (Linting)
- Nodemon
- dotenv (Environment variables)

## Commands

- `npm run dev` runs the dev server using nodemon
- `npm start` runs the main node server
- `npm run lint` runs the linter
- `npm run fix` runs the linter and fixes auto fixable problems
- `npm test` runs the test suite if tests exist

You should be able to get started pretty quick from this point.

Good luck, and have fun!
